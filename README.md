## Project Description

Cryptocurrency price prediction is a challenging task due to the high volatility of the market. This project explores machine learning models to analyze and predict future prices based on historical data. Random Forest and KNN are employed to provide two different approaches for making predictions.

## Features

- Predict cryptocurrency prices using two different algorithms.
- Visualize the predicted vs. actual price trends.
- Data preprocessing and feature extraction from historical cryptocurrency data.
